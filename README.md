**Soil** is a modular AI-enhancement modification for Arma 3.

The project is entirely **open-source** and all contributions are welcome. Feel free to maintain your own custom version, so long as the changes you make are open to the public in accordance with the GNU General Public License ([GPLv3](https://github.com/Soil/Soil/blob/master/LICENSE)).

The aim of the project is to improve the players' experience in fighting against the AI by giving additional information to the AI and by assisting it in its decisions.
